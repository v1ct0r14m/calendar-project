# calendar-project
from module #5

Here we were asked to create a simple calendar.

Edited 23:30 16 Sep 2022

In this project, we built a site to aid organization and timekeeping on a daily basis. 
There are chronological time blocks to indicate the hours, a space in the center to add important events throughout the day, and a save button to save the information into local storage and enable the user to view the events during different browser visits.
Development has been furthered since submission on 15 Sep, but there is still a ways to go.
However, this project did push me past a block of feeling inadequate in realizing that I was at that moment.
Inadequacy is the state prior to adequacy.
I need to learn, and I need to learn more.
To learn multiple new languages for a world unknown is difficult.
The fault in this progammer [me, typing this] is one of delegation.
I've lived very autonomously, and I've lived very structured- finding a balance of the two is the game of this course.
Anyways, unsure of how formal I am to be in these readme's currently, I do understand that I will need to provide true and sufficient information of the program and how it runs in future challenges and projects.
A tutorial or example on a proper/professionl/expected readme would be kinda cool.
Apologies for the state of the code, and for the moodiness off-screen.
It's been a heck of a time.
